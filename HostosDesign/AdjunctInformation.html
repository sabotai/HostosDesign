<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Do I need an ID to enter the building?</span></h2>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Initially no.  You need only tell security that you are a new adjunct and you are here to get the paperwork started.  When they ask where you are going tell them C-515 the Apple Lab.  You will need to go to HR in the B building to take care of your paperwork and you will need to go to IT ,also in the B building, to secure email address, etc.</span></div>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Where do I go to fill out paperwork and what do I need to have with me?</span></h2>
<div><em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">You need to go to HR on the 2nd floor in the "B" building room B-215 to fill out the paperwork.  You must have a valid form of </span></span><strong><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">Government-issued ID</span></span></strong><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;"> (Drivers License or Passport) and your </span></span><strong><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">Social Security card.</span></span></strong></em></div>
<div><em><strong></strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">HR Regular Office Hours</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">:  Monday thru Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</span></em></div>
<div><em><em><span style="color: #000000;">HR Summer Hours:</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> Monday thru Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.</span></em></div>
<div><em><span style="color: #000000;">New Employee Page of Hostos HR Website: </span><a href="http://www.hostos.cuny.edu/ohr/newemp/Index.html"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.hostos.cuny.edu/ohr/newemp/Index.html</span></a></em></div>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">How do I get an ID and Email Address?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Once you have completed your paperwork with HR you can get your ID in the basement of the "B" building.  Once you have your ID you can go to IT in the "B" building  room B-425 and receive your email address and password for all your Hostos communication.  It is suggested that once you sign up for your email address you should register for the </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Self-Service Password Management</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">.  This will ensure that you are able to reset your password remotely.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Please Note:  THIS CAN TAKE TIME.  You are unable to access email until the PAR (official appointment) has been approved.  There is nothing we can do until this time.  Approval is expected the 2nd week of school.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #444444;">How do I get a roster for my class?</span></h2>
Login to Cuny first you will have access to your rosters.
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Where do I pick up keys to room?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">When you are notified that your keys are ready for pickup (via email and memo in your box) you can go down to the basement in the C building to room C030 Public Safety.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Do I have a box where I receive departmental communication and official paperwork?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Yes.  Written communication will be placed in a box labeled with your name in room C416 Adjuncts room. </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Check this box each week and please treat requests with URGENCY.</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> There will often be situations where certain departments (HR, IT) might be closed during the hours you are at Hostos or our Humanities Assistant, Wendy Pimentel, or the Visual and Performing arts Assistant, Irma Silva, have already left for the day by the time you arrive.  We will need to deal with these obstacles on a case-by-case basis.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Faculty Restrooms</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">The Ladies/Mens Restroom on the 5th floor is not great -- is there another restroom for ladies/men to use? YES! The Restrooms on the 4th floor are for Faculty and Staff only. The password for the Ladies is 758341#. The password for the Mens is 872534# (the lock is wonky... keep trying). Please do not distribute this password to any students -- this is expressly for Faculty and Staff.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Do I have to hold Office Hours?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Part-time faculty with two or more courses should hold 1.0 hr of office hours per week.  Please send Marie Gonzalez (mgonzalez@hostos.cuny.edu)  in the Humanities Department office an email with the day and time that you will be holding office hours.  You are not required to have an office hour if you are teaching just one course.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Do I have access to the classroom before class begins?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Availability depends on the schedule but it is usually 15 minutes in advance of the start of class.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Will there be a slide projector I can plug my laptop into?</span></h2>
<em><span style="color: #000000;">If you are scheduled to teach in room C516: </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">Yes.  There is an instructor's station with projector.  To turn on the projector power button on the wall above the station.  Please remember to always power down the projector after use.  You may connect your own laptop to this projector, as well.</span>
<em><span style="color: #000000;">If you are scheduled to teach in another room: </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">We'll have an AV cart for you in the Hostos Digital offices in room C515-A (in the back of the Design Lab) with VGA cable (bring an adapter as needed).</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Are there any supplies provided or available?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Students should be expected to bring supplies that you list in the syllabus.  No other supplies are able to be provided.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Is there a DryErase Board in the classroom?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">There is a DryErase Board in room C516.  Markers are available in the office if they are not on the tray of the board itself.  The availability in other classrooms must be confirmed on a case-by-case basis.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Email Questions:</span></h2>
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">What is the email policy for teachers?  Should I give out my personal email?  Will there be a school email that I may use for students to reach me?</span></strong>
<span style="color: #000000;">You will be given a hostos email which we suggest that you use.  Other professors have given students personal email and phone number in the past.  Use your own judgement here.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Will there be web access for teachers and students to share projects over a server?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Public Folders are available within the Lab and C516 Classroom.  The Dropbox function can be enabled if it is not already done so in System Preferences &gt; Sharing. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Where can I get a hold of the school schedule?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">This is on the Hostos website:  http://www.hostos.cuny.edu/oor/academic/calendar.html</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Also, you may subscribe to an iCal calender of the school schedule: </span><a href="webcal://ical.me.com/catherinelewis/HOSTOS%20ADJUNCT%20CALENDAR.ics"><span style="color: #000000;">Hostos Academic Calendar for iCal</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">
Please note that each class should meet for 14 classes and the final would be the 15th meeting of the class.  This detail can help in navigating the semester.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">How do I make copies of my syllabus or other handouts?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Duplicating in the "B" building basement for your use.  They can usually get them turned around on the same day if there are fewer than 100 copies, I think.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Also, it is required that you send your syllabus to Marie Gonzalez  (<a href="mailto:adlopez@hostos.cuny.edu">mgonzalez@hostos.cuny.edu</a>) in the Humanities Department office each semester by the end of the first week of school.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Do I have to keep attendance?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Yes.  At the end of the semester you will need to email a copy of your attendance to Marie Gonzalez  (<a href="mailto:adlopez@hostos.cuny.edu">mgonzalez@hostos.cuny.edu</a>) in the Humanities Department office.  In addition, there will be a scantron document in your box after the third meeting of your class. </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">You will need to fill this form in completely and on-time as students' financial aid depends on it. </span></em>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">When will I get an official class list?</span></h2>
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #000000;">If you are a returning professor then you might have your class listed in Blackboard.  You must have registered with the CUNY Portal to access this.  Here are the directions:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Go to www.cuny.edu.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Click on "Portal Log-in/Blackboard/eSIMS" link in left-hand navigation</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Click on "Blackboard 8 Direct &gt;&gt;"</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Enter Login and Password (Again, you will have had to register your Hostos email address with the CUNY Portal to have access)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Click on the chosen class from the list in the right-hand column.  The class will only be listed once it is confirmed that you are teaching (that enrollment is acceptable).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Click on "Control Panel" from the left-hand navigation.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Click on "List/Modify Users" from the "User Management" Pane on the right hand side of the page.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Click on the "List All" tab.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Click the "List All" button to confirm.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A list of registered students should appear.  Please note that if your class has more than 20 students or so there might be a second page of names which you can access through navigation at the bottom of the page.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The list can be copied and pasted into most all word processing or spreadsheet applications.</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Do students get a detailed course description or syllabus?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Professors are responsible for printing up their version of the syllabus that was provided by the Hostos Digital Program and handing it out on the first day of class.   Changes to the syllabus can involve ALL BUT Overview &amp; Objectives.</span>
<h2>Am I able to use Blackboard in my class?</h2>
YES! We highly recommend that you make available the Blackboard site for all of your courses...even if you are only posting the course syllabus. Here are two video screenshots to help you with this.  Reach out to me at CLEWIS@hostos.cuny.edu if you are interested in a more in-depth tutorial of Blackboard.

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Are the required books available in the school bookstore?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">The required design books are not for sale in the Hostos Bookstore.  PDFs should be available on all desktops in the Lab, we can keep them on the website for them, and copies of most books are available at the Reserves Desk of the Hostos Library in the "A" building (just across the bridge).</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Will I have my own login on the instructor's station computer either in C516 or on the AV Cart laptop?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Yes, new professors will be added to the login list on the necessary computer.  The laptop password should be the professor's first name.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Is there wifi access? If so, how do I get password?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">There is no password for WIFI on campus but you will need to sign in using an outside email address or your Hostos email and password.  The WIFI is spotty in classrooms on the 4th floor, so an ethernet cable is available on the AV Cart.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">How do I submit grades?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Grades are submitted on-line.  When the end of the semester arrives you will receive notice that the On-line grading system is available via a link on the Hostos website.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #444444;">What if a student has been absent more than three times?</span></h2>
The policy stated on all Digital Design syllabi (unless changed by the professor) and supported by our program is that students will receive a failing grade if they are absent more than 3 times.  Thus, a student will fail after their 4th absence.  Ultimately, any variance of this policy is up to the individual professor.  Please reach out to full-time faculty for any questions or concerns about individual students.
<h2><span style="color: #444444;">What is the difference between giving a student a "D" and an "F"? </span></h2>
<span style="color: #444444;">There is a very important difference between giving a student a "D" and an "F" and how it affects a student's GPA.  A "D" calculates into a student's GPA as a 1.0 and an "F" is averaged in as a 0.0.  However, a student is allowed to <strong>retake</strong> a class where they have received an "F" and their GPA will be calculated based on the <strong>new grade, </strong>thus saving their GPA in the long run.  The student's transcript will show an "R" for the original semester when the student received the failing grade.</span>
<span style="color: #444444;">The full-time faculty in the Digital Programs encourage adjuncts to email students with "D" averages about the differences between these two grades and ask them whether they would be interested in receiving an "F" so that they can retake the class and have the opportunity to get a better grade and have stronger GPA.  The full-time faculty often suggests this pathway in hopes that the student will also <strong>learn</strong> more the second time in the classroom and feel success in overcoming past failures. </span>
<span style="color: #444444;">Please reach out to full-time faculty with questions and concerns regarding individual failing students.  Thank you for your sensitivity on this point.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">What do I need to turn in at the end of the semester?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">Each professor should email to Marie Gonzalez  (<a href="mailto:adlopez@hostos.cuny.edu">mgonzalez@hostos.cuny.edu</a>)  in the Humanities Department office the following:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A document showing your </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">grades</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> for the semester.  Simply print the screen when you submit your final grades via the on-line system.  Please make sure that the class # and semester are clearly visible.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A document showing </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">attendance</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> for your class for the semester.  Again, please make sure that the class # and semester/year are clearly visible.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Are tutors available to help my students?</span></h2>
<span style="color: #000000;">The Apple Lab in C-515 has College Lab Assistants (CLA) who are there to assist your students.  Not all CLA's are well-versed in applications such as AfterEffects and Maya or mark-up languages such as HTML and CSS.  Please let us know if this creates a problem in your class and we can address it.</span>
